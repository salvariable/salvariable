# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a React Native developer with 2y experience working with core and community components. Before that I worked +5y as a manager for digital projects, most of the time doing UX and working with multidisciplinary teams to adhere as strictly as possible to the user's needs, requirements and expectations.

  <p>ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently working on side projects with React Native (even RNW), Context API and GraphQL</p>
  <p>ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mobile projects with a social impact</p>
